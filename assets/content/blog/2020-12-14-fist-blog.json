All three pages have actually no dynamic data involved (as you can see in the source code). The text, the images and everything else are completely hardcoded. Last year, the page was served from one of my Virtual Private Servers (VPS) by always running Node.js server. The only purpose of it was to respond with the same content again and again.\n\nAt some point, I thought that there must be a better way, so I started using Nuxt.js as Static Site Generator. Now no Node server was involved anymore, only plain HTML files that were served by the VPS. Not too bad, but… why do I need a **server at all** for managing a simple static page? Correct, I **do not!** But more about that in a second.\n\n<!--EndFragment-->"
